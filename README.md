# polypatch

Given a plot of Y vs X, select an interval of X and fit a polynomial to the data. Optionally, select a sub-interval of X to be ignored by the fit.

The code forces the fit to pass through the two last and two first data point in the selected interval. This, in order to achieve a smoother mathing between the data and the fit. As a result, the degree of the fit must be 3 or higher. This is done by means of Lagrangemultipliers.

The plots are generated by the Python package Matplotlib that provides interactive tools like zooming, dragging, and rescaling, which are all useful for data exploration.

## Example

Short explanation of the figure:

1. It selects the interval to be considered for the fit (red curve).
2. It selects the interval to be excluded from the fit (black vertical lines).
3. It performs the polynomial fit by selecting a degree and then clicking the button (green curve).

After closing the windows, the following summary will be displayed on the console:

=========================================
Interval for the fit:
xmin = 0.0143, 	xmax_fit = 0.0313
=========================================
Interval excluded from the fit:
xmin = 0.0192, 	xmax = 0.0252
=========================================
Polynomial degree of the fit = 3
=========================================

Run the program
Make sure you are using Python3 and have installed the following Python packages:

Numpy (https://www.numpy.org/)
Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
Scipy (https://www.scipy.org/)
